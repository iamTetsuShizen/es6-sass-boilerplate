# ES6 & SASS Boilerplate

A boilerplate for every lightweight frontend project.

<br/>

Starting with Webpack as a glue for everything, I wanted to mantain it simple so it remains fully customizable.

Using @babel compiler to be able to code your project in es6 right away!

Also with Sass and the internal folder structure as the 7-1 Pattern describes.


I'd love to hear your feedback and review your PRs!
